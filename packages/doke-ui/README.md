# doke-ui

A beautifully designed API documentation UI for the doke documentation generator.

## Issues

1. [Unexpected increase in memory usage when building Next.js from within Docker](https://github.com/VVSOGI/doke-ui/issues/62)

## Overview

doke-ui is the frontend component of the doke API documentation system. Built with Next.js, it provides a modern, responsive interface for browsing and testing API endpoints. The UI is designed to be more visually appealing and user-friendly than traditional API documentation tools like Swagger UI.

## Features

- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface built with React and Next.js
- **Interactive Documentation**: Test API endpoints directly from the UI
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **CORS Protection**: Proxies API requests through Next.js server to avoid CORS issues

## Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install doke-ui

# Using yarn
yarn add doke-ui
```

## Usage

doke-ui is designed to be used as a standalone application. It reads API documentation generated by doke-nest and provides a user interface for exploring and testing the API.

### Running the UI

```bash
# Development mode
yarn dev

# Production build
yarn build
yarn start
```

By default, the UI will run on port 3001. You can access it at http://localhost:3001.

## How It Works

doke-ui operates as follows:

1. Reads API documentation from the `api-docs` directory generated by doke-nest
2. Renders a user-friendly interface for exploring API endpoints, parameters, and responses
3. When testing an API endpoint:
   - The request is sent to the Next.js server first
   - The Next.js server forwards the request to your actual API server
   - This proxy approach prevents CORS errors that would occur with direct browser-to-API requests

### API Request Flow

```
Client Browser → doke-ui (Next.js) → Your API Server (NestJS)
```

This flow avoids Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors that would occur if the browser tried to directly access your API server from a different origin.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn dev
```
